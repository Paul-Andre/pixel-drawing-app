# pixel-drawing-app
HTML5 pixel art drawing app where multiple users can connect

#Try it out
To try it out, run
```shell
npm install
```
After which you could run
```shell
sh testing.sh
```
which would basically copy all the code in a separate directory and execute it there.

If you don't want this, you can simply run
```shell
node startApp.js
```
which would execute the app.

Then open your browser at localhost:8000

Currently this only works well on desktops
