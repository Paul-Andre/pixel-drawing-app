#Try it out
To try it out, run
```shell
npm install
```
After which you could run
```shell
sh testing.sh
```
which would basically copy all the code in a separate directory and execute it there.

If you don't want this (or don't have sh on your computer), you can simply run
```shell
node startApp.js
```
which would execute the app.

Then open your browser at localhost:8000

Currently this only works well on desktops.
